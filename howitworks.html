    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p><em>The mutoscope was simple machinery, When one would turn the crank, the worm would engage the teeth of the gear and cause the center spool to rotate resulting in the flip book to spin creating a motion picture. Turning the crank on the side of the mutoscope also would lift a tiny brass switch near the lightbulb which turned the bulb on so that viewers could see the image in the light.</em>
    </p>
    
	<p>The Mutoscope, patented by Herman Casler, was built off inspiration from existing and similar technology. Its invention revolutionized the peep-show industry. <br> Like Thomas Edison’s Kinetoscope, it did not project on a screen and provided viewing to only one person at a time. Cheaper and simpler than the Kinetoscope, the system, quickly dominated the coin-in-the-slot peep-show business.<br>
The mutoscope relied on human interaction to operate which some say enforces the erotic phenomenon of the mutoscope. The device operated simply: When one would turn the crank, the worm would engage the teeth of the gear and cause the center spool to rotate resulting in the flip book to spin creating a motion picture. Turning the crank on the side of the mutoscope also would generate electricity for the lightbulb on the inside to illuminate the cards. <img align = "right" width = 30% src = "../images/diagram2.jpg"> <br> 
Another thing that made the mutoscope so special in contrast to other devices was the aspect of changing content. The apparatus was generally made of cast iron or tin to protect the delicate cards from being damaged. All mutoscopes would have a removable side hatch to make repairs easily and for the effortless changing of the flip book.  <br>
 After putting your penny in the slot you would peer through the lens to view the content, this adds to the “peepshow” aesthetic that made the mutoscope so popular especially in its later years. 
</p>
<p>
The mutoscope was very easy to operate, which contributed to its popularity.
