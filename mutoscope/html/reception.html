    <h2>Reception</h2>
    <p>The mutoscope was invented in 1894, it was widely popular in the late Victorian era. Mutoscopes were often placed in penny arcades and on British piers. <br>
Before internet pornography, before VCRs, before sleazy cinemas, there was the peep show industry. The Mutoscope contributed to the peep show industry that dominated the arcade world, showing short approximately one minute films  such as “What The Butler Saw”. <br>
The cultural phenomenon behind this is interesting because often times the women being showed through these machines seemed unaware that they were being filmed, which was intended to make viewers feel like peeping toms. <br>
However, the mutoscope started off it’s lifetime showing short films starring people such as Charlie Chaplin. It was later used in showing erotic and explicit imagery. This caused an uproar against the Mutoscope claiming it was “corrupting youth”. This, however did not make the device less widely popular. <br>
A conceptual problem with the Mutoscope was that only one person could view at a time which made it tough to compete with projected film. <br> Promoters of the Mutoscope (KMCD Syndicate) tried to compete by creating “Mutoscope Parlours” that would be home to several mutoscopes so that one could view the same reel with a group of people. Eventually the Mutoscope became obsolete and many were thrown off the piers due to the lack of profit they generated.
