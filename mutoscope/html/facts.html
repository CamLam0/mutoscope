        There are a handful of Mutoscope “Pin-Ups” that can be found, which vary in rarity. They are typically cheeky and exhibit the dirty humor that was associated with the “peep-show” nature of the Mutoscope. Now referred to as “Peep-Machine Pin-Ups,” these mutoscope slides originated in the 1940-1950s.

    <p>A variety of short poems have been written about, or mention, the mutoscope. It is assumed that the peep-show-esque nature of the mutoscope intrigued many artists and poets, that led to the creation of these poems. The most known of these poems is <i>Mutoscope</i> by Elizabeth Spires, and is as follows: <br> <em>Swirl and smash of waves against the legs <br>
and crossgirders of the pier, I have come to Brighton, <br>
come as the fathers of our fathers came, <br>
to see the past’s Peep Show. <br>
On two good legs, on one, they came, <br>
veterans and stay-at-homes of the Great War, <br>
all casualties, to stroll the West Pier’s promenade, <br>
past bands, flags, and minstrel shows, <br>
past Gladys Pawsey in a high-necked bathing costume <br>
riding her bicycle off the high board, <br>
past Hokey-Pokey and Electric Shocker, <br>
to the old Penny Palace, pennies burning hotly <br>
in their hands, the worn watery profile <br>
of Queen Victoria looking away from it all. <br>
I bend to the mutoscope’s lit window <br>
to see “What the Butler Saw”: a woman artlessly <br>
taking off her clothes in a jerky striptease <br>
I can slow down or speed up <br>
by turning the handle of the mutoscope. <br>
Easily I raise her from darkness— <br>
the eye eternally aroused by what it can’t touch— <br>
to watch her brief repeating performance <br>
that counts for so little. Or so much. <br>
I can’t be sure which. <br>
Abruptly, THE END shuts down the image, but her story <br>
continues as she reverses time’s tawdry sequence <br>
to dress and quickly disappear <br>
down a maze of narrow streets and alleys<br>
filled with the ghostly bodies and bodiless ghosts<br>
of causality, the unredeemed and never-to-be-born<br>
bearing her along to a flight<br>
of shabby stairs, a rented room where she is free<br>
as anyone to dream her dreams and smoke a cigarette,<br>
smoke from the lit tip spiraling<br>
in patternless patterns toward the room’s bare light bulb,<br>
the light I see her by harsh, violently<br>
unforgiving, as she makes tomorrow into a question<br>
of either/or: to leave this room, this vacancy<br>
forever, or go on exactly as she has before.<br>
Old ghost, your history is nameless and sexual,<br>
you are your own enigma, victim<br>
or heroine of an act of repetition that, once chosen,<br>
will choose you for a lifetime.<br>
I peer into the tunneled past,<br>
so small, so faraway and fragmentary,<br>
and yet, not unconnected to what I am now.<br>
Dilapidation upon dilapidation, Brighton<br>
is crumbling, fading to sepia tones,<br>
as your unfunny burlesque continues past<br>
your life, perhaps past mine,<br>
the past preserved and persevering,<br>
the sentimental past.<br>
