    <h2>The Inventor</h2>
    <h3>Herman Casler</h3>
    <p> <img align = "left" src = "../images/herman.jpg">Herman Casler (left) was born in Fort Plain, NY in 1867. <br>
    He started working as an apprentice to cousin, inventor Charles E. Lipe. He worked from Lipe from 1889 - 1893. <br> From 1893-1895, Casler worked for General Electric Co. as a draftsman - he designed electric rock drills. <br>  <img align = "right" src="../images/founders.jpg" alt = "Founders od KMCD Group">
    Herman co-founded KMCD group (right), which became the American Mutoscope and Biograph company.  <br>
    Casler formed the Marvin &amp; Casler Co. with Harry Marvin, which made a range of products (engines, machines, automatic palm readers, motion picture machines). Soon after, Casler became the sole owner, sold the company in 1919.   <br>
        He retired in 1926 but remained as a consulting engineer for other businesses even into his retirement.

    <h3>Inventions</h3>
    <p>  W.K.L. Dickson suggested that Casler create the Mutoscope, which was ready by fall 1894. It was initially a competitor of Edisonâ€™s kinetoscope. <br>
    Casler developed the Mutagraph, a camera, prototyped by June 1895. <br>
    Casler designed the Biograph projector. <br>
    In 1900 Casler helped develop a portable hand-cranked camera. <br>
    Casler patented the Mutoscope on October 8th, 1901. <br>
    Filed his final patent in 1937.
